# edgemodelr 0.4.1

## CRAN Resubmission Fixes

* **Stderr references in compiled objects** (CRAN auto-check NOTE on
  Debian): the previous CRAN cleanup (commit d8870bd) added stdio
  suppression to 7 upstream files but missed `ggml/ggml.c` and
  `ggml/ggml-opt.cpp`. Both now include the same `#ifdef USING_R`
  macro block that neutralizes `printf`, `fprintf`, `fputs`, `fflush`,
  `stderr`, and `stdout`. These calls were diagnostic-only and were
  already silent at runtime via the installed log callback; now the
  symbols never reach the compiled object files either.

# edgemodelr 0.4.0

## Structured Output, Embeddings, RAG, and API Server

### New Features

* **Grammar-constrained generation** (`edge_grammar_completion()`): Force model
  output to conform to a GBNF grammar specification. Ensures valid, parseable
  structured output (JSON, enums, numbers, etc.) using llama.cpp's native
  grammar sampler.

* **JSON schema helper** (`edge_json_grammar()`): Convert a simple R list
  schema into a GBNF grammar string. Supports string, number, integer,
  boolean fields and enum (character vector) constraints.

* **Structured data extraction** (`edge_extract()`): High-level function that
  combines prompt construction with grammar-constrained generation to extract
  structured data from text. Returns a parsed R list (requires `jsonlite`).

* **Text classification** (`edge_classify()`): Classify text into predefined
  categories using grammar constraints. Supports single text and batch
  (vectorized) classification. Output is guaranteed to be one of the
  specified categories.

* **Text embeddings** (`edge_embeddings()`): Extract dense vector embeddings
  from any loaded model. Returns a numeric matrix (n_texts x n_embd) suitable
  for clustering, semantic search, similarity computation, and RAG pipelines.
  Supports optional L2 normalization.

* **Cosine similarity** (`edge_similarity()`, `edge_similarity_matrix()`):
  Compute pairwise cosine similarity between embedding vectors. Matrix version
  efficiently computes all-pairs similarity using normalized matrix multiply.

* **Embedding dimension query** (`edge_model_n_embd()`): Query the embedding
  dimension of a loaded model.

* **Batch processing** (`edge_map()`): Apply a prompt template over a vector
  of texts with progress reporting. Supports both string templates with
  `{text}` placeholder and custom prompt functions. Optional grammar
  constraint for structured batch output.

* **Batch extraction** (`edge_extract_batch()`): Extract structured data from
  multiple texts, returning a data frame with one row per input.

* **RAG document indexing** (`edge_index_documents()`): Build a semantic
  embedding index from a directory of text files or a character vector.
  Automatic chunking with configurable size and overlap.

* **RAG semantic search** (`edge_search()`): Find the most relevant text
  chunks for a query using cosine similarity over the embedding index.

* **RAG question answering** (`edge_ask()`): Retrieval-augmented generation
  that retrieves relevant context from an index and generates a grounded
  answer. Supports custom system prompts and optional context return for
  debugging/transparency.

* **Plumber API server** (`edge_serve()`): Serve a model as a local
  OpenAI-compatible REST API. Endpoints: `/v1/completions`,
  `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`, `/health`.
  Supports optional API key authentication and CORS. Requires `plumber`.

* **Qwen3 model family** in `edge_list_models()`: Added Qwen3-0.6B, 1.7B,
  4B, and 8B pre-configured entries from the unsloth GGUF repository.

* **Friendly names in `edge_download_model()`**: Now accepts model names from
  `edge_list_models()` (e.g., `edge_download_model("Qwen3-0.6B")`) in addition
  to HuggingFace repo IDs. Filename is auto-resolved from the model registry.

* **httr download fallback**: `.robust_download()` now tries `httr::GET` before
  R's `download.file`, improving reliability on corporate networks with custom
  SSL certificates or proxy configurations.

* **SIMD optimization warning**: On package load, warns if running without SIMD
  (generic mode) and suggests reinstalling from source with
  `EDGEMODELR_SIMD=NATIVE` for faster inference.

### Bug Fixes

* **Fixed grammar-constrained generation failures** (issue #41):
  `edge_grammar_completion()`, `edge_extract()`, and `edge_extract_batch()` were
  unusable due to two bugs. First, `edge_json_grammar()` emitted rule names like
  `field_1` containing underscores, which llama.cpp's grammar parser rejects
  (only `[a-zA-Z0-9-]` is allowed in rule identifiers). Renamed to `field-1`.
  Second, `llama_sampler_accept()` throws "Unexpected empty grammar stack" when
  a token fully satisfies the grammar; the binding now catches this and
  terminates cleanly, same as end-of-generation handling.

* **Fixed crash from silent context size override** (issue #40 item 11):
  Removed the auto-reduction of `n_ctx` for small models that silently changed
  the user's requested context size. This caused segfaults when prompts exceeded
  the reduced context. Context is now used as-is. Minimum `n_ctx` lowered from
  512 to 128 for short-task use cases.

* **Fixed prompt echo in completion output** (issue #40 item 1):
  `edge_completion()` previously returned `prompt + generated_text`. Now returns
  only the generated text, matching user expectations.

* **Added prompt length validation**: All completion functions now validate that
  the tokenized prompt fits within the model's context window before calling
  `llama_decode()`. Exceeding the context now raises a clear R error instead of
  crashing the process.

* **Model-native chat templates** (issue #40 item 7): New
  `edge_chat_completion()` function reads the model's chat template from GGUF
  metadata (via `llama_chat_apply_template`) and formats messages correctly for
  each model architecture (ChatML, Llama, Gemma, etc.). `build_chat_prompt()`
  updated to accept an optional `ctx` parameter for native template formatting,
  with ChatML as the generic fallback (replacing the old `Human:/Assistant:`
  format).

### Use Cases Unlocked

* **Sentiment analysis**: `edge_classify(ctx, text, c("positive", "negative", "neutral"))`
* **Entity extraction**: `edge_extract(ctx, text, list(name = "string", role = "string"))`
* **Data labeling**: Batch classify thousands of rows with guaranteed valid labels
* **Semantic search**: Embed documents and queries, find nearest neighbors
* **Document clustering**: Compute similarity matrices, feed to hclust/kmeans
* **RAG foundations**: Embed corpus, retrieve relevant context for generation

# edgemodelr 0.3.0

## CUDA GPU Support and Qwen3 Tokenizer Fix

### New Features

* **CUDA GPU acceleration** (Windows): New `edge_install_cuda()` and
  `edge_install_cuda_toolkit()` functions set up GPU inference automatically.
  - `edge_install_cuda()` downloads the matching `ggml-cuda` dynamic backend
    from llama.cpp releases and extracts the companion `ggml-base.dll` /
    `ggml.dll` runtime libraries.
  - `edge_install_cuda_toolkit()` copies `nvcudart_hybrid64.dll` from the
    Windows DriverStore (already on any NVIDIA-driver machine, no download
    required) and fetches `cublas64` / `cublasLt64` from NVIDIA's redistrib
    server.
  - `edge_reload_cuda()` activates the CUDA backend in the current R session
    without restarting R.
  - `edge_cuda_info()` reports whether CUDA is installed and active.
  - Pass `n_gpu_layers = -1L` to `edge_load_model()` for full GPU offload.
  - Tested on NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti (Blackwell sm_120, CUDA 13.1, 12 GB VRAM):
    Qwen3-14B loads in 3.4 s with full VRAM offload.

* **Updated llama.cpp to build b8179 (GGML 0.9.7)**: Brings all upstream
  model architecture updates, sampler improvements, and quantization fixes.

### Bug Fixes

* **Qwen3 / QWEN2 tokenizer 40-minute load time** (8000× speedup): The
  QWEN2 byte-level regex pattern caused GCC's `std::regex` to spend 40+
  minutes in exponential backtracking. Added a hand-written fast path
  `unicode_regex_split_custom_qwen2()` in `unicode.cpp`, matching the logic
  of the existing llama-3 fast path. Qwen3-14B now loads in 0.3 s on CPU
  (3.4 s on GPU including VRAM transfer). Covers QWEN2 and QWEN3.5 variants.

### CRAN Compliance

* Replaced `abort()` in `ggml_abort()` with `raise(SIGABRT)` under
  `#ifdef USING_R`; replaces `abort()` token in `ggml.cpp` with
  `std::terminate()`.
* Guarded `ggml_print_backtrace()` body and `fflush(stdout)` /
  `fprintf(stderr, …)` in `ggml_abort()` with `#ifndef USING_R` to remove
  `_Exit`, `stdout`, and `stderr` symbol references from `ggml.o` on macOS.
* Added `#define _GNU_SOURCE` to `ggml-cpu.c` (required for `SCHED_BATCH`,
  `CPU_ZERO`, `pthread_setaffinity_np` on Linux).
* `CXX_STD = CXX17` replaces `-std=c++17` in `PKG_CXXFLAGS` in both
  `Makevars` and `Makevars.win`.
* `-fno-builtin-printf` added to `GGML_CFLAGS` to suppress
  `printf → puts` optimizations.
* Man pages added for `edge_install_cuda`, `edge_install_cuda_toolkit`,
  `edge_reload_cuda`, `edge_cuda_info`.

## SIMD Optimizations for Faster CPU Inference

### New Features

* **Flash attention support**: Enabled by default in `edge_load_model()` via `flash_attn = TRUE`. Reduces memory usage and improves attention computation speed on CPU.

* **Full hardware thread utilization**: Removed the 4-thread cap for small contexts. `edge_load_model()` now uses all available CPU threads by default, with `n_threads_batch` set to max for prompt processing.

* **User-configurable threading**: New `n_threads` parameter in `edge_load_model()` allows explicit control over CPU thread count. Pass `NULL` (default) for auto-detect or an integer to limit cores.

* **Apple Accelerate framework** (macOS): Automatically links the Accelerate framework on macOS builds, enabling hardware-accelerated vDSP vector operations for faster matrix math.

* **Compiler auto-vectorization**: Added `-ftree-vectorize` to GGML compilation flags on all platforms, allowing GCC/Clang to generate SIMD instructions for eligible loops beyond the hand-tuned GGML kernels.

### Existing Features

* **SIMD-optimized build system**: Replaced generic scalar fallback with architecture-aware SIMD detection in both `Makevars` (Unix) and `Makevars.win` (Windows)
  - x86_64: Enables SSE4.2 baseline by default (universal since Intel Nehalem 2008)
  - aarch64/arm64: NEON support built into the ABI (no extra flags needed)
  - Other architectures: Automatic generic fallback

* **User-configurable SIMD levels**: Set `EDGEMODELR_SIMD` environment variable before install to select optimization level:
  - `GENERIC`: Scalar fallback (maximum compatibility)
  - `SSE42`: SSE4.2 baseline (default on x86_64)
  - `AVX`: AVX + F16C (Intel Sandy Bridge 2011+)
  - `AVX2`: AVX2 + FMA + F16C (Intel Haswell 2013+, recommended)
  - `AVX512`: AVX-512 (Intel Skylake-X 2017+)
  - `NATIVE`: Uses `-march=native` for maximum performance on the build machine

* **`edge_simd_info()`**: New function to query compile-time SIMD status including architecture, compiler features, and GGML optimization flags

* **x86 architecture-specific quantization**: Enabled optimized x86 quantization kernels (`arch/x86/quants.c`, `arch/x86/repack.cpp`) with SIMD-accelerated dot products and matrix operations

### Performance

* 15-40% faster inference on x86_64 with SSE4.2 baseline vs generic scalar
* Up to 2-3x faster with AVX2 for quantized model operations
* SSSE3-accelerated integer multiply-accumulate for quantized dot products
