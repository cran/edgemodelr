# edgemodelr 0.2.0

## SIMD Optimizations for Faster CPU Inference

### New Features

* **Flash attention support**: Enabled by default in `edge_load_model()` via `flash_attn = TRUE`. Reduces memory usage and improves attention computation speed on CPU.

* **Full hardware thread utilization**: Removed the 4-thread cap for small contexts. `edge_load_model()` now uses all available CPU threads by default, with `n_threads_batch` set to max for prompt processing.

* **User-configurable threading**: New `n_threads` parameter in `edge_load_model()` allows explicit control over CPU thread count. Pass `NULL` (default) for auto-detect or an integer to limit cores.

* **Apple Accelerate framework** (macOS): Automatically links the Accelerate framework on macOS builds, enabling hardware-accelerated vDSP vector operations for faster matrix math.

* **Compiler auto-vectorization**: Added `-ftree-vectorize` to GGML compilation flags on all platforms, allowing GCC/Clang to generate SIMD instructions for eligible loops beyond the hand-tuned GGML kernels.

### Existing Features

* **SIMD-optimized build system**: Replaced generic scalar fallback with architecture-aware SIMD detection in both `Makevars` (Unix) and `Makevars.win` (Windows)
  - x86_64: Enables SSE4.2 baseline by default (universal since Intel Nehalem 2008)
  - aarch64/arm64: NEON support built into the ABI (no extra flags needed)
  - Other architectures: Automatic generic fallback

* **User-configurable SIMD levels**: Set `EDGEMODELR_SIMD` environment variable before install to select optimization level:
  - `GENERIC`: Scalar fallback (maximum compatibility)
  - `SSE42`: SSE4.2 baseline (default on x86_64)
  - `AVX`: AVX + F16C (Intel Sandy Bridge 2011+)
  - `AVX2`: AVX2 + FMA + F16C (Intel Haswell 2013+, recommended)
  - `AVX512`: AVX-512 (Intel Skylake-X 2017+)
  - `NATIVE`: Uses `-march=native` for maximum performance on the build machine

* **`edge_simd_info()`**: New function to query compile-time SIMD status including architecture, compiler features, and GGML optimization flags

* **x86 architecture-specific quantization**: Enabled optimized x86 quantization kernels (`arch/x86/quants.c`, `arch/x86/repack.cpp`) with SIMD-accelerated dot products and matrix operations

### Performance

* 15-40% faster inference on x86_64 with SSE4.2 baseline vs generic scalar
* Up to 2-3x faster with AVX2 for quantized model operations
* SSSE3-accelerated integer multiply-accumulate for quantized dot products

# edgemodelr 0.1.5

## CRAN Policy Fixes

### Bug Fixes

* **Fixed donttest examples**: Changed resource-intensive examples from `\donttest{}` to `\dontrun{}` to prevent downloading multi-GB models during CRAN checks

* **Fixed M1 Mac compiler warnings**: Added explicit `static_cast<>` for:
  - `double` to `float` conversions for temperature/top_p parameters
  - `size_type` to `int32_t` conversions for buffer size parameters

* **Fixed connection handling**: Replaced `on.exit()` with `tryCatch/finally` for proper connection cleanup in loops (thanks @eddelbuettel)
